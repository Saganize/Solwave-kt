# Solwave-kt 

Solwave, A Kotlin SDK, enables in-app transactions for Solana mobile dApps, allowing developers to implement in-app transactions within their mobile applications without having to build an independent wallet for their users.

## Why integrate it?
1. **Swift Approvals**: In-app functionality ensures faster transaction approvals, resulting in smoother user interactions.

2. **Effortless Transactions**: The Solwave SDK simplifies transactions by seamlessly integrating with popular wallets like Phantom and Solflare along with the Saganize wallet, offering users an expanded range of choices.

3. **Empowering Developers**: Developers can focus on creating exceptional mobile experiences, without the requirement of setting up in-app wallets.

4. **Ironclad Security**: Rest assured, your transactions are protected by our state-of-the-art encryption, guaranteeing the highest level of security.

## Features
1. **Seamless Onboarding**: Users can seamlessly onboard (create a Saganize wallet) through the SDK.

2. **Effortless Setup**: Users need to log in to their Saganize account just once for a hassle-free experience.

3. **Swift PIN-Based Approvals**: With a swift PIN entry, users can easily approve transactions without any disruptions.
